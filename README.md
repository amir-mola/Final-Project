# Final-Project


**What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.**
We are using csv files the Google has collected from its searches. We access it through Google Trends, which allows us to see the frequency of specific movies that were googled from 2004 to now by state.

**Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.**
Our target audience is for film producers who would like to see which kinds of movies are popular amongst specific regions.

**What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.**

**Create at least 5 GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project.  You should assign these to individual group members to complete**

**How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?**

**What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?**

**What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)?**

**What major challenges do you anticipate?**
